This is an R Markdown document. The first step is to read the file and create a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("~/R/R_lectures/Data_cousera/reproducible/activity.csv")
library(ggplot2)
total_steps <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total_steps, binwidth = 500,xlab="Steps per day")
mean(total_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(total_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Now, a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis) is created here

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
average <- aggregate(x=list(steps=activity$steps), by=list(interval=activity$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=average, aes(x=interval, y=steps))+geom_line()+xlab("5-min interval")+ ylab("average across all days")
max(average$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```


Number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc
```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
library(plyr)
library(Hmisc)
imputed_activity <- activity
imputed_activity$steps <- with(imputed_activity, impute(steps, mean))
total_imputed <- tapply(imputed_activity$steps, 
                              imputed_activity$date, sum)
mean(total_steps)
mean(total_imputed)
median(total_steps)
median(total_imputed)
qplot(total_imputed, xlab='Total steps')
```
